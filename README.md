# Go Fund Yourself
The Platform Where Users Can Keep Track of Their Grants and Project Funding.

## Description
This project was built within 6 days as my final project during my enrollment at the Spiced Academy Bootcamp. As an avid music fan I am trying to combine my funding and coding skills to develop a unique platform to help guid artists through the confusing and complex process of applying and accounting for cultural funding programs. 
So far, the project consists of some basic features. With this app you can add funding projects to your profile and add, update and delete cost positions and keep track of how much money you have forecasted and will eventually spend. Furthermore, charts and tables provide a visual expense overview making it easier for the user to track and analyze their project. 

## Tech
This Project was built on the PERN Stack. I used React/Redux, Node.js/Express and PostgreSQL.
Other Libraries I used were:
- Bycrypt
- chart.js
- cookie session
- moment
- mui/x-data-grid for tables

## Motivation
I created this project to practice my React and Redux skills, as well as SQL and getting more familiar with Dataflow. Particularly challenging for me was figuring out data flow and calculations with decimal numbers in JS.

## TODOS
- change user profile
- update project details
- add and save files in db to all cost positions
- add incoming positions
- add team members to the projects
- create chat function
