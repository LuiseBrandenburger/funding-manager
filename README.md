## Overview
This project was built within 6 days as my final project during my enrollment at the Spiced Academy Bootcamp. As an avid music fan I am trying to combine my funding and coding skills to develop a unique platform to help guid artists through the confusing and complex process of applying and accounting for cultural funding programs. 
So far, the project consists of some basic features. With this app you can add funding projects to your profile and add, update and delete cost positions and keep track of how much money you have forecasted and will eventually spend. Furthermore, charts and tables provide a visual expense overview making it easier for the user to track and analyze their project. 

## Tech
This Project was built on the PERN Stack. I used React/Redux, Node.js/Express and PostgreSQL.
Other Libraries I used:
- Bcrypt
- chart.js
- cookie session
- moment
- mui/x-data-grid

## Features
- Registration and login is possible as part of the functionality
- User security is provided by utilizing bcrypt to protect users password
- Users are able to add projects to their profile and switch between projects
- Users are able to add, update and delete cost positions to their projects
- Users are able to sort costs data and export the data as pdf or CSV
- Users are able to view the data in charts or tables
