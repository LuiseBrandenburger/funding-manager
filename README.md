# Go Fund Yourself
Platform where users can keep track of their grants and project funding.

## Description
This project was built within 6 days as my final project during my enrollment at the Spiced Academy Bootcamp. As an avid music fan I am trying to combine my funding and coding skills to develop a unique platform to help guid artists through the confusing and complex process of applying and accounting for cultural funding programs. 
The Project so far contains basic features. With this app you can add funding projects to your profile and add, update and delete cost positions in that project. You can keep track of how much money you have forecasted and eventuelly spend. Charts and Tables will give you a visual overview of your costs and make it easier for you to track your project. 

## Tech
This Project was build on the PERN Stack. I used React/Redux, Node.js/Express and PostgreSQL.
Other Libraries I used are:
- Bycrypt
- chart.js
- cookie session
- moment
- mui/x-data-grid for tables

## Motivation
I created this project to practice my React and Redux skills, as well as SQL and getting more used to the Dataflow. A special challenge for me was figuring out the data flow and calculations with decimal numbers in JS.

## TODOS
- change user profile
- update project details
- add and save files in db to all cost positions
- add incoming positions
- add team members to the projects
- chat function
